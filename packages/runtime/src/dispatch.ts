/**
 * dispatch.ts — the ONLY send path in this repo (research/06-architecture.md §3.3, §8
 * guardrail #2; docs/build-conventions.md guardrail #2).
 *
 * MECHANICAL GUARDRAIL #2 ("a human approves every send"): `dispatchDraft` is the single
 * function, in this package and in the whole repo, that is allowed to call
 * `OutreachChannel.dispatch`. It is authoritative from the SYSTEM OF RECORD in `memory` — it
 * never trusts the caller-supplied `Draft`/`Approval` objects' own fields. Before it touches the
 * channel it (via `assertDispatchable`, below):
 *   - re-reads the PERSISTED draft by id and refuses if it isn't in the system of record at all
 *   - refuses if the persisted draft's status is already `"dispatched"` (no re-send)
 *   - structurally re-checks the PERSISTED draft against the approval via `assertApproved` (an
 *     `Approval` was supplied, `decision === "approve"`, `draftId === draft.id`,
 *     `draft.status === "approved"`) — against the persisted draft, not the caller's copy
 *   - verifies the supplied `Approval` corresponds to a REAL, persisted, hash-chained row in the
 *     `approvals` audit log (not merely an object that *looks like* a valid Approval), and that
 *     the audit chain itself verifies
 * Any violation throws a clear `Error` BEFORE the channel is called — never after, never
 * partially. On success: call the channel with the PERSISTED draft, mark it `dispatched` in
 * memory, then build, persist, and return the canonical `Outcome` row (this function — not the
 * channel — is what `memory` learns "sent" from; the channel's own returned Outcome may carry
 * channel-specific metrics, folded in below, but this function owns the row of record).
 *
 * WHY re-derive everything from `memory` instead of trusting the arguments: a caller working
 * from untrusted/deserialized input (or simply a stale in-process object) can construct a
 * `Draft`/`Approval` pair that is internally *consistent* — matching ids, `status:'approved'`,
 * `decision:'approve'` — without either one ever having actually gone through
 * `DraftStore#approve` / `MemoryRepo#appendApproval`. Checking only internal consistency between
 * the two supplied objects cannot tell a forged pair from a real one. Re-reading the draft and
 * requiring the approval to exist as a hash-chained row in `memory` closes that gap: both must be
 * real, on record, decisions this process actually made — not merely well-shaped arguments.
 *
 * `assertApproved` is exported so `channels.ts` implementations can defensively RE-verify the
 * same structural invariant (the seam contract in `@mstack/core`'s `seams.ts` requires every
 * `OutreachChannel` implementation to verify this itself, not just trust its caller) without
 * duplicating the logic. It stays a pure, synchronous, argument-only check — it deliberately does
 * not talk to `memory`; the system-of-record verification lives in `assertDispatchable` /
 * `dispatchDraft` alone, upstream of every channel. Re-asserting in a channel does not create a
 * second "send path" — it is a guard, not a dispatch call; see `dispatch.test.ts`'s guardrail
 * test, which grep-scans this package's production source for actual `*.dispatch(` CALL sites
 * (as opposed to the `dispatch(...)` METHOD DEFINITIONS every channel implementation necessarily
 * has) and asserts there is exactly one, here.

/**
 * Verifies `draft`/`approval` against the SYSTEM OF RECORD in `memory` and returns the persisted
 * `Draft` row that `dispatchDraft` must use downstream (never the caller-supplied `draft`).
 * Throws a clear `Error` on the first violation found, in this order:
 *
 *   1. the draft isn't in `memory` at all (never saved, or a wrong/forged id)
 *   2. the persisted draft's CURRENT status is already `"dispatched"` — refuses a re-send. This
 *      is what closes the realistic (sequential) double-send / TOCTOU window: re-reading and
 *      checking the CURRENT persisted status immediately before the channel call means a second
 *      `dispatchDraft` call for an already-dispatched draft is refused even if the caller still
 *      holds an in-memory `Draft`/`Approval` pair that looks perfectly valid (e.g. reused from
 *      the first, successful call).
 *   3. the persisted draft fails the structural `assertApproved` check against `approval` (e.g.
 *      status is still `"pending"`/`"rejected"`, or the approval's `draftId`/`decision` don't
 *      match)
 *   4. the supplied `Approval` does not correspond to a REAL, persisted, hash-chained row in the
 *      `approvals` audit log — `approval.id` isn't on record, or the on-record row's
 *      `decision`/`draftId` don't match, or the audit chain itself doesn't verify. This is what
 *      defeats a FORGED `Approval`: an attacker (or buggy caller) who constructs a
 *      plausible-looking `Draft`/`Approval` pair cannot fabricate a row that both exists in
 *      `approvals` AND satisfies `verifyAuditChain()`, because the hash chain is computed
 *      server-side by `MemoryRepo#appendApproval` from the real insertion order and prior hash —
 *      it cannot be produced by merely constructing a JS object with the right shape. Note this
 *      step re-checks the RECORDED `decision`/`draftId` (from the row in `memory`), not the
 *      caller-supplied `approval`'s own fields — a caller cannot pass off a real approval id for
 *      a *different* draft/decision by lying about the fields on its local copy.
 *
 * DOUBLE-SEND — closed by the read-side gate here PLUS the write-side atomic claim downstream:
 * this function closes the SEQUENTIAL case (the second call re-reads status, sees `"dispatched"`,
 * and is refused). The true concurrent RACE (two `dispatchDraft` calls both reading `"approved"`
 * before either writes `"dispatched"` — classic check-then-act TOCTOU) and the retry-after-crash
 * case are closed one step downstream by `dispatchDraft`'s ATOMIC claim:
 * `MemoryRepo#claimDraftForDispatch` runs a single `UPDATE drafts SET status='dispatched' WHERE
 * id=$id AND status='approved' RETURNING id` immediately BEFORE the channel call and proceeds only
 * if it changed the row, so at most one caller can ever win. `assertDispatchable` stays the
 * READ-side gate (existence, persisted status, a real hash-chained approval, the content binding);
 * the claim is the WRITE-side gate. Both are needed — this check refuses forged/mismatched/tampered
 * inputs before any write; the claim serializes the one legitimate send. This holds under the
 * package's single-writer embedded-DuckDB model and remains correct if the backing store later
 * moves to Postgres (the conditional UPDATE is the same atomic primitive there).
