/**
 * draft-store.ts — the ONLY way a `Draft` enters or leaves the `pending` state in this repo
 * (research/06-architecture.md §3.3, §8 guardrail #2).
 *
 * `save()` always forces `status:'pending'` — no caller of this class can hand it a
 * pre-approved draft and skip the human gate. `approve()`/`reject()` append a hash-chained
 * `Approval` row via `MemoryRepo#appendApproval` (which owns the actual prevHash/hash
 * computation — see `@mstack/memory`'s `memory-repo.ts`; this class deliberately does not
 * duplicate that logic) and then flip the draft's status. Neither method ever calls a
 * channel — that is `dispatch.ts`'s job alone, downstream of `approve()`.
 *
 * ADDITIVE (Wave C4, research/10-sota-integration-design.md §2.9): `save()` may ring an
 * optional `ApproverNotifier` (default `noopApproverNotifier`) AFTER the pending draft is
 * persisted — a best-effort "a draft is pending" DOORBELL (e.g. HumanLayer Slack/email).
 * It is the doorbell, NOT the ledger: it cannot approve, dispatch, or change status, and
 * a throwing/hanging notifier is swallowed so it can never affect the persisted draft or
 * the approval gate. The record is still `approve()`'s hash-chained `Approval`; the only
 * send is still `dispatch.ts`. Default is the no-op, so the offline path is unchanged.
